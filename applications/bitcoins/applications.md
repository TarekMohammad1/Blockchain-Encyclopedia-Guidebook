# Applications

We now expand what we already know about bitcoin by seeing it as an application platform. These days, the term "blockchain" is frequently used to describe any application platform that adheres to bitcoin's design tenets. The phrase is frequently misapplied and used to describe a wide range of items that fall short of offering the key benefits that bitcoin's blockchain offers.

### Money Transfer

Transfer apps for cryptocurrencies are now experiencing an explosion in popularity, led by Bitcoin. Due to the time and money that blockchain may save financial institutions of all kinds, it is particularly well-liked in the industry.

Blockchain can save the biggest banks a ton of money by decreasing third-party fees, getting rid of bureaucratic red tape, and making ledger systems real-time. These businesses efficiently move money using blockchain technology.

### Internet of Things (IoT)

The next logical explosion in blockchain applications is the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT offers a wide range of uses and several security issues, and as the number of IoT products rises, hackers will have more opportunities to steal your data via devices ranging from Amazon Alexa to smart thermostats.

Blockchain-infused Through the use of technology's transparency and theoretical incorruptibility to keep things "smart," IoT adds an additional layer of security to avoid data breaches. The businesses using blockchain to improve the Internet of Things security and intelligence are listed below.

### Healthcare

Despite its early usage, blockchain in healthcare is already showing some potential. Early blockchain systems have really demonstrated the ability to lower healthcare expenses, increase stakeholder access to information, and simplify business procedures. To ensure that an already bloated sector can reduce extravagant expenses, an innovative system for gathering and sharing private information may be exactly what the doctor ordered.

### Government

Blockchain technology may have some of the most unexpected uses in bettering government. While some state governments already use the technology to encrypt official documents, blockchain can also alleviate significant budgetary burdens and increase bureaucratic accountability and efficiency. Blockchain technology has the ability to reduce the amount of time spent on administrative tasks by millions of hours each year, hold public authorities responsible through smart contracts, and increase transparency by keeping a public log of all activity.
