# Intro

Bitcoin has been known as a fully digital currency, with no government to issue it and no need to manage the account over verify the transactions.

It can be treated as money, participants make payments, exchange, and store value using bitcoin currency units. Almost anything that can be done with conventional currencies can be done with bitcoin, including sending money to individuals or organizations, purchasing and selling items, and extending credit. The technology is freely accessible thanks to the open-source Bitcoin protocol stack, which can be run on a variety of computers, including laptops and smartphones.

At specialist exchanges, bitcoin can be bought, sold, and traded for other currencies. Due to its speed, security, and lack of geographical boundaries, bitcoin is in some ways the ideal form of money for the internet.

Bitcoin is totally virtual, in contrast to conventional currencies. There aren't any actual coins, not even any digital ones. A distributed, peer-to-peer system, Bitcoin. There isn't a "central" server or point of control as a result. Additionally, bitcoin cannot be artificially increased by "creating" more coins than it is anticipated to be issued. The protocol, a peer-to-peer network, and a distributed computing invention are all called bitcoin.&#x20;

Actually, the use of this idea in the bitcoin currency is just the beginning. With four major technical advantages combined, Bitcoin is the result of decades of research in distributed systems and cryptography.

* Bitcoin protocol
* Distribute ledger
* Consensus rules
* Proof-of-Work algorithm

These early digital currencies were functional, but because they were centralized, they were vulnerable to attacks from governments and hackers. Similar to a typical banking system, early digital currencies employed a central clearinghouse to settle all transactions at regular intervals.&#x20;

### History of Bitcoin <a href="#user-content-history-of-bitcoin" id="user-content-history-of-bitcoin"></a>

A decentralized currency without the need for a central bank or any intermediaries, Bitcoin was initially presented in 2008. It may be sent to and received from users using the peer-to-peer bitcoin network, where transactions are verified by nodes and stored on a blockchain.

When Nakamoto mined the first block of the blockchain in 2009, after it had been made available as open-source software, Bitcoin was used for the first time. The first 50 Bitcoins were created in this block, which is known as the Genesis Block. From that point on, other early donors kept mining Bitcoin until 2010.

With three distinct moves, the People's Bank of China started the most significant regulations:

* The bank forbade the use of Bitcoin by financial institutions in December 2013.
* It declared a total ban on Bitcoin use in September of 2017.
* It started to crack down on significant cryptocurrency miners in June 2021.
