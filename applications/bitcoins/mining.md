# Mining

### Basic Rule

One of the most unique concepts in Bitcoin is "mining". Mining refers to the process of maintaining nodes in the network to obtain a certain amount of new bitcoins by assisting in the generation and confirmation of new blocks.&#x20;

When a user publishes a transaction to the Bitcoin network, someone needs to record and confirm the transaction, form a new block, and connect it to the blockchain. In a distributed system that does not trust each other, who should do this? The Bitcoin network uses "mining" to solve this problem.&#x20;

At present, a block of no more than 1 MB in size is generated every 10 minutes or so, which is concatenated to the end of the longest chain, and the successful submitter of each block can get The system's 12.5 bitcoin reward, and the user's payment service fee attached to the transaction. Even without any user transactions, miners can generate legitimate blocks by themselves and get rewards. The reward for each block is initially 50 bitcoins, and it is automatically halved every 210,000 blocks, that is, 4 years, and the total number of bitcoins is stable at 21 million. Therefore, Bitcoin is a deflationary currency.

### Mining Process

New transactions are verified by miners before being added to the global ledger. Every 10 minutes on average, a new block is "mined," adding the transactions that have happened since the last block to the blockchain. The new owners of bitcoin are able to use the bitcoin they got in those transactions since confirmed transactions are those that are included in a block and uploaded to the blockchain.

A block reward, also known as a coinbase reward or new coins minted with each new block, and transaction fees from all the transactions included in the block are the two forms of incentives that miners receive in exchange for the security that mining provides. Miners compete to solve a challenging mathematical problem based on a cryptographic hash algorithm in order to receive this reward. The answer to the issue, known as the Proof-of-Work, is incorporated into the new block and serves as evidence that the miner put forth a lot of computational work. The foundation of bitcoin's security architecture is the competition to solve the Proof-of-Work algorithm in order to receive the reward and the ability to log transactions on the blockchain.

### Transaction Fees

Transaction fees are a source of income for bitcoin miners. A transaction fee is often included in every transaction and takes the form of extra bitcoin over the transaction's inputs and outputs. The successful bitcoin miner gets to "keep the change" on all of the transactions that are a part of the successful block. The great bulk of a bitcoin miner's income now comes from newly created bitcoin, with fees accounting for 0.5% or less of their total income. However, a larger part of bitcoin mining profits will come from fees as the block reward declines over time and the number of transactions per block rises. Transaction fees will eventually make up the majority of the mining reward, providing miners with their main incentive. After 2140, there is no longer any new bitcoin in any block, and transaction fees will be the primary source of incentive for mining bitcoin.

The decentralized consensus mechanism that supports bitcoin's security will be discussed after we first look at mining as a means of generating currency.
