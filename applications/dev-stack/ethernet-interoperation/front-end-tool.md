[Web3.js](https://medium.com/coinmonks/web3-js-ethereum-javascript-api-72f7b22e2f0a) is a JavaScript library that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain. It enables us to make requests to each Ethereum node with JSON RPC to read and write data to the network. There are a couple of replacements for web3.js such as [Eth.js](https://github.com/ethjs), [Ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/), and [Web3Wrapper](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/development/packages/web3-wrapper).&#x20;
