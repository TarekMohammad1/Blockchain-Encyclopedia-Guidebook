# The Merge

{% embed url="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/" %}

The Merge represents the joining of the existing execution layer of Ethereum (the Mainnet we use today) with its new proof-of-stake consensus layer, the Beacon Chain. It eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining and instead secures the network using staked ETH. A truly exciting step in realizing the Ethereum vision â€“ more scalability, security, and sustainability.

It's important to remember that initially, the [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/beacon-chain/) shipped separately from [Mainnet](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#mainnet). Ethereum Mainnet - with all it's accounts, balances, smart contracts, and blockchain state - continues to be secured by [proof-of-work](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/), even while the Beacon Chain runs in parallel using [proof-of-stake](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/). The approaching Merge is when these two systems finally come together, and proof-of-work is replaced permanently by proof-of-stake.



Throughout Ethereum's history, developers have been hard at work preparing for an eventual transition away from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. On December 1, 2020, the Beacon Chain was created, which has since existed as a separate blockchain to Mainnet, running in parallel.

The Beacon Chain has not been processing Mainnet transactions. Instead, it has been reaching consensus on its own state by agreeing on active validators and their account balances. After extensive testing, the Beacon Chain's time to reach consensus on more is rapidly approaching. After The Merge, the Beacon Chain will be the consensus engine for all network data, including execution layer transactions and account balances.

The Merge represents the official switch to using the Beacon Chain as the engine of block production. Mining will no longer be the means of producing valid blocks. Instead, the proof-of-stake validators assume this role and will be responsible for processing the validity of all transactions and proposing blocks.

No history is lost. As Mainnet gets merged with the Beacon Chain, it will also merge the entire transactional history of Ethereum. You don't need to do anything. Your funds are safe.





### After The Merge <a href="#after-the-merge" id="after-the-merge"></a>

This will signal the end of proof-of-work for Ethereum and start the era of a more sustainable, eco-friendly Ethereum. Learn more about [Ethereum energy consumption](https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/).

This will also set the stage for further scalability upgrades not possible under proof-of-work, bringing Ethereum one step closer to achieving the full scale, security and sustainability outlined in its [Ethereum vision](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/vision/).



### What happened to 'Eth2'? <a href="#eth2" id="eth2"></a>

The term 'Eth2' has been deprecated as we approach The Merge.

After merging 'Eth1' and 'Eth2' into a single chain, there will no longer be two distinct Ethereum networks; there will only be Ethereum.

To limit confusion, the community has updated these terms:

* 'Eth1' is now the 'execution layer', which handles transactions and execution.
* 'Eth2' is now the 'consensus layer', which handles proof-of-stake consensus.
