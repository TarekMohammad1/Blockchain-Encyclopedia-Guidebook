# PagTerra-Luna Case: The Start of Doubt:

It looks like there is an underlying problem when it comes to algorithmic-backed stablecoins. Most of the major ones according to the Fed have failed. So, let’s see a famous case, TerraUSD freefall, and see how to reflect on DAI.&#x20;

Terra blockchain is a blockchain ecosystem that hosts two types of cryptocurrencies: TerraUSD (UST) is the stablecoin of the blockchain and LUNA is the governance token. By arbitraging price disparities between the two coins, this two-coin system was created to keep the price of TerraUSD near $1. The supply of Luna decreased as demand for TerraUSD rose, driving up the price of Luna and vice versa.&#x20;

Additionally, another component of the system called Anchor, which is also on the same blockchain, encouraged demand for TerraUSD. With deposits from TerraUSD, Anchor was a loan program that offered interest rates of up to 20%. (Consider this in light of the fiat underpinning portfolio’s above performance.) Demand for TerraUSD increased as a result of these alluring interest rates, causing it to rise astronomically.&#x20;

Early in May of 2022, Anchor lowered its deposit rates, which caused withdrawals. It was like a bank run as people exchanged their TerraUSD for other currencies. As the demand for TerraUSD decreased, the price of Luna also decreased because more Luna stock was created to try to keep the TerraUSD peg in place. Eventually, TerraUSD completely collapsed as the cost of Luna dipped below zero. It’s important to note that the Luna Foundation had been hoarding Bitcoin since January for backup plans (basically a backing portfolio), and this was mostly sold to attempt and support the price of TerraUSD. When the Bitcoin portfolio was finally implemented, the values of Terra and Luna had already started to fall, making it too little, too late. There was no way to restore the system’s equilibrium because the peg of TerraUSD to the US dollar was broken and both currencies’ prices were falling.

Now, having discussed the dramatic end of Terra-Luna, let’s dig deep into DAI:
