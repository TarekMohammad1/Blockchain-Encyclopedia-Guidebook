# Stablecoins: definitions, types, and use-cases

Stablecoins are digital currencies linked to a benchmark and stored on distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), most often blockchains. The vast majority of stablecoins in circulation are tied to the U.S. dollar, although stablecoins can also be linked to other fiat money, currency baskets, other cryptocurrencies, or physical goods like gold. On DLTs, stablecoins act as a store of value and a medium of exchange, allowing them to be traded or combined with other digital assets.&#x20;

Since 2020, there has been a significant increase in the use of stablecoins stored on open blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. The largest USD-pegged public stablecoins had a combined circulating supply of approximately $130 billion as of the end of September 2021. Figure 1 depicts how the growth in the number of public stablecoins in circulation over the first five months of 2021 averaged roughly 30% month over month.

There are three main types of stablecoins:

1. Public reserve-backed: Backed by cash-equivalent reserves (deposits, T-bills, commercial paper), issued by centralized firms. Main coins: Tether, USD Coin (USDC), Binance USD (BUSD), Paxos Dollar (USDP).
2. Public algorithmic Backed by overcollateralized cryptocurrency and/or smart contracts that automatically defend the peg by buying or selling the stablecoin. Main coins: Dai, TerraUSD (failed), Fei, IRON (failed), Basis (failed).
3. Institutional or private Issued by financial and non-financial institutions for internal account transactions, liquidity management, and transactions between user accounts within the same private network. Main coins: JPMCoin.



Use cases of Stablecoins:

1. Digital markets: Stablecoins are used to trade digital assets and serve as an onramp from fiat currency to digital assets recorded on blockchains.
2. Payments: Stablecoins are used to facilitate fast peer-to-peer and cross-border payments. They also hold the potential for new payment innovations, such as programmable money.
3. Internal transfers and liquidity management: Institutional stablecoins facilitate transfers of funds within a firm and allow efficient movement of internal cash across subsidiaries to manage liquidity risk and regulatory requirements.
4. Defi: The programmability and composability of stablecoins currently support decentralized, blockchain-based cryptocurrency markets and services, known as decentralized finance or DeFi. Protocols allow for market making, collateralized lending, derivatives, asset management, and other services.
