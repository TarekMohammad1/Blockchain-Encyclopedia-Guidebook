# Challenges

The absence of testing tools is one of the biggest problems. For each blockchain framework, there are currently just a few testing tools available; utilizing the incorrect tool may result in issues. The blockchain ecosystem's lack of professional experience is another problem. Blockchain technology hasn't been widely adopted by software developers because it's still a young concept in the computer world.

Testing a strategy presents even another difficulty. Blockchain testing requires in-depth knowledge of the technology's operation.
