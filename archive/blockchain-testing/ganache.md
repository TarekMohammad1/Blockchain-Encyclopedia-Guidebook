# Ganache

Ganache is used to develop, deploy, and test a smart contract.&#x20;

### Create a Workspace

After downloading the ganache application, we can either quick-start a blockchain instant or create a new workspace for our example.

### Launching a Personal Blockchain

Quick-start will launch a personal block for testing purposes only with Ethereum for testing and its address to make transactions.&#x20;

### Test our project

Use network id and the RPC server to hook up our project with the personal blockchain on Ganache.&#x20;
