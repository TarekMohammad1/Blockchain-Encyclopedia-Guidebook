# Types of Blockchain

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Decentralization is the goal of blockchain itself, but as more application scenarios are discovered, people often need to make a trade-off for the degree of decentralization with blockchain performance, management complexity, and system security.

As shown in the table below, the types of blockchain are divided into Public chain, Private chain, and Consortium chain [\[1\]](types-of-blockchain.md#undefined). The core difference between them is the read and write access and the degree of decentralization. Public chains are open to everyone, private chains are open to individuals who meet certain conditions, and consortium chains are open to authorized organizations or institutions. In essence, consortium chains also belong to private chains, but the degree of privatization is different. Generally speaking, the higher the degree of decentralization, the higher the trustworthiness, and the lower the transaction efficiency.

#### **Public Blockchain**

The Public blockchain refers to a blockchain in which anyone in the world can access the system at any time to read data, send confirmable transactions, and compete for billing. A public chain is often considered “completely decentralized” because no single person or organization can control or tamper with the reading or writing of the data. The public chain generally encourages participants to compete for billing through a token mechanism to ensure data security. Bitcoin and Ethereum are typical public chains.

#### **Private Blockchain**

Private blockchain refers to a Blockchain in which writing access is controlled by an organization or institution, and the eligibility of participating nodes is severely limited. Since the participating nodes are limited and controllable, the private chain can often have extremely fast transaction speed, better privacy protection, lower transaction costs, less vulnerability to malicious attacks, and can meet the requirements necessary in the financial industry such as identity authentication. In contrast to a centralized database, a private chain prevents a single node in an organization from deliberately concealing or tampering with data, and allows the source to be discovered quickly even if errors occur. Therefore, many large financial institutions are more inclined to use private chain technology at present.

#### **Consortium Blockchain**

Consortium Blockchain refers to a group of organizations that operate on one or more nodes, each containing data that is only allowed to be read, written, sent, and recorded by different organizations within the system. A consortium chain is actually a concept between a public and private chain, which to some extent allows various organizational structures to cooperate and maintain the blockchain together. Consortium chains are usually permissioned blockchains, for example, hyperledger fabric introduced an additional permission management mechanism, which is a typical example of a consortium blockchain structure.

#### **Permissioned Blockchain**

Permissioned Blockchain refers to the fact that every node participating in a Blockchain system is licensed. Unlicensed nodes cannot be connected to the system, so both private and consortium chains are licensed. Some license chains have no token mechanism because there is no need for tokens to encourage nodes to compete for billing. Generally speaking, Public Blockchains are often referred to as the non-permission chains, whereas consortium blockchains are typically the permission chains.\
