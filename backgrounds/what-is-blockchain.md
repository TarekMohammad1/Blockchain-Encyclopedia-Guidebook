# What is Blockchain?

{% hint style="info" %}
**Knowledge:** Blockchain might not necessarily be defined as a new technology, but rather as a fusion of multiple existing technologies that combine knowledge from a variety of fields, such as distributed computing, cryptography, databases, trusted computing, and so on.

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Simply put, a blockchain can be described as a database shared among multiple distributed nodes. The data stored on the chain is highly unforgeable, verifiable, accessible traceable, and transparent, without the need for a publicly trusted authority [\[1\]](what-is-blockchain.md#reference). The implementation of blockchain technology is based on peer-to-peer transmission, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic algorithms, and is widely used in various scenarios to solve collaboration problems among multi-parties through its shared ledger due to its transparency characteristics [\[2\]](what-is-blockchain.md#reference). The basic components of blockchain can be broken down into three parts: distributed ledger, consensus algorithm, and smart contracts [\[3\]](what-is-blockchain.md#reference).

The earliest conception of blockchain applications can be traced back to a well-known paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” [\[4\]](what-is-blockchain.md#reference), in which blockchain is a distributed ledger-style data structure for digital currency scenarios. It describes blockchain as a distributed bookkeeping technology that uses a chained data structure to provide a tamper-proof data record using digital digests. But in fact, the use of chained structures and the comparison between hash values and timestamps to ensure data security, have been proposed as early as 1990 in an article called “How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document” [\[5\] ](what-is-blockchain.md#reference)by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.
