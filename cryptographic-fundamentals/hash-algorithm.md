# Intro

In blockchain technology, a lot of cryptographic knowledge is used to ensure the security of the system. There are many branches of cryptography, so here is only a superficial introduction to the cryptographic knowledge applied in the blockchain.

Blockchains and distributed ledgers make extensive use of the latest achievements in cryptography and security technologies, especially those related to authentication and privacy protection. Blockchains use cryptographic security-related technologies including Hash algorithms and digests, encryption algorithms, digital signatures and certificates, PKI systems, Merkle trees, Bloom filters, homomorphic encryption, and others. These cryptographic applications achieve security, privacy, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of the blockchain.

Cryptography can be divided into classical cryptography and modern cryptography.

* Classical cryptography focuses on the confidential writing and transmission of messages and their corresponding deciphering methods.
* Modern cryptography is not only concerned with message confidentiality, but also with all information security issues related to message integrity verification (message authentication codes), non-repudiation of message distribution (digital signatures), and attacks from both internal and external sources arising in distributed computing.

&#x20;In short, modern cryptography is the cornerstone of Internet security.
