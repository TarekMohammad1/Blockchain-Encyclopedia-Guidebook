# Black Thursday

Fears of a global pandemic caused the price of ETH to plummet rapidly on March 12, 2020, by more than 30% in less than 24 hours. One of the largest stress tests for the still-developing Defi sector was this one. As a result of several individuals attempting to enhance their collateral in various loans or trying to trade between other assets, the Ethereum gas fees dramatically increased to over 200 gwei (which was extremely high at the time).&#x20;

Maker was among the protocols that were most impacted by this incident. The Keeper bots, who are the external participants in charge of liquidations, were able to bid 0 DAI for the auctioned ETH collateral as a result of the wave of liquidations brought on by users’ ETH collateral decreasing value. This caused a $4 million shortage in ETH, which was eventually made up by issuing and auctioning more Maker’s MKR tokens.&#x20;

Even though occurrences like Black Thursday can be fairly severe, they typically reinforce the entire Defi ecosystem, making it more and more antifragile in the end. This brings us to the main Defi growth season, commonly known as the ”Defi Summer.”
