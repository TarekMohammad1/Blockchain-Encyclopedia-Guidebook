# Defi Summer

The Compound’s May 2020 launch of its COMP token liquidity mining program served as the primary impetus for Defi Summer. Beginning with Compound, Defi users began to receive rewards for lending and borrowing. The additional incentives in the form of COMP tokens caused a significant increase in supplying and borrowing APYs for various tokens. Additionally, because users were encouraged to alternate between borrowing and lending various tokens to maximize yield, yield farming was also made viable.&#x20;

This incident also marked the beginning of a wave of additional protocols, which distributed their tokens via liquidity mining and expanded the availability of yield farming. Additionally, it established compound governance, allowing holders of COMP coins to cast votes on various protocol amendment proposals. Compound’s governance model was later reused by multiple other DeFi projects.&#x20;

This brings us to Yearn Finance, another significant Defi protocol. Yearn is a yield optimizer that concentrates on maximizing Defi capabilities by automatically switching between several loan protocols. It was created by Andre Cronje in early 2020.&#x20;

Andre made the decision to give the Yearn community access to the governance token YFI in July 2020 in order to further decentralize Yearn.&#x20;

No VCs, funder prizes, or developer incentives were used in the token’s complete distribution via liquidity mining. The Defi community embraced this idea, with over $600M in locked value pouring into the incentive-driven liquidity pools.&#x20;

When the token was first listed on Uniswap, its price was roughly $6. Less than two months later, it had risen to over $30,000 per token. Yearn’s success was rapidly followed by numerous other teams launching comparable projects with a few slight modifications, as with pretty much all landmark efforts in Defi.&#x20;

Ampleforth was another project that began gaining popularity as a result of its distinctive elastic supply approach.&#x20;

Another Defi protocol, Yam, immediately repeated and replicated this paradigm. On August 11, 2020, Yam debuted after only 10 days of development. In keeping with YFI, YAM coins were released, and the protocol soon attracted a lot of liquidity. By paying owners of COMP, LEND, LINK, MKR, SNX, and YFI for staking their tokens on the Yam platform, the protocol hoped to generate interest in strong Defi communities.&#x20;

With $0.5B of total value locked in the protocol just one day after launch, a serious flaw in the rebase mechanism was discovered. Despite further attempts to relaunch the protocol, the flaw that affected only some of the liquidity providers in one of the pools, yCRV-YAM, was enough to cause users to lose interest in Yam.&#x20;

Next is SushiSwap. The protocol, which was introduced at the end of August 2020 by an unnamed team, presented a new idea of a ”sucker attack” that sought to drain liquidity from Uniswap. SushiSwap was able to draw up to $1B in liquidity by offering Sushi tokens as incentives to Uniswap’s liquidity providers. Following the considerable controversy, including the chief SushiSwap developer ChefNomi losing all of his SUSHI token holdings, the protocol was eventually able to transfer a significant portion of Uniswap’s liquidity to their new platform.&#x20;

There were numerous other projects of varying quality that were introduced during the Defi Summer. The majority of them were just versions of already-existing open-source projects attempting to capitalize on the overconfidence in an entirely new industry. Following the debut of Yam and Sushi, numerous new projects with names derived from various meals were introduced. Pasta, spaghetti, kimchi, hot dogs, and other foods were available. These foods were referred to as food finance or food Defi. After a day or two of curiosity, nearly all of them failed.&#x20;

The introduction of the Uniswap token, UNI, was one of the defining moments of Defi Summer. A retrospective airdrop worth well over $1k was given as compensation to all former Uniswap users and liquidity providers. Additionally, Uniswap launched its liquidity mining program across four separate liquidity pools, bringing in over $2B in liquidity. Most of it was returned to SushiSwap.&#x20;

All of the major Defi measurements experienced a significant improvement over Defi Summer.&#x20;

By September 2020, Uniswap’s monthly volume had increased from $169M in April 2020 to over $15B. Tremendous growth of approximately 100 times. By September, the total value locked in Defi had increased from $800M in April to $10B, a tenfold rise. From 20,000 Bitcoins transferred to Ethereum in April to around 60,000 in September, a threefold rise.
