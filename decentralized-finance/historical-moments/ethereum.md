# Ethereum

If Bitcoin acts as a global currency for its store of value, Ethereum is the medium of exchange. Ethereum is the go-to blockchain when it comes to financial system applications. Every robust financial system needs a set of other important services such as lending, borrowing, trading, funding, or derivatives. Bitcoin is based on a language called “Script”, which does not serve well financial needs. Script’s limitations were one of the most important factors that contributed to the creation of Ethereum by Vitalik Buterin. Ethereum’s inception was in 2015 and traction was gained quickly as more developers were provided with the perfect tooling to build all kinds of decentralized applications, especially Defi ones. Ethereum became a go-to smart contract platform to build on, with its Turing-complete programming language Solidity and the ERC20 standard for creating new tokens.
