# ICOs

ICOs, one of the first significant use cases for Ethereum, also gained popularity in 2017. Instead of using conventional means to raise capital, new initiatives have begun to swap their own tokens for ETH. Although the concept of decentralized fundraising was not a bad one, in theory, it led to a number of overhyped initiatives raising an excessive amount of money with little more than a few pages of a whitepaper to show for it. There were several ventures in the profusion of ICOs that today would be categorized as Defi. A list of the most successful Defi projects from the ICO era:

**Aave** – Lending and borrowing&#x20;

**Synthetix (previously known as Havven)** – a liquidity protocol for derivatives&#x20;

**REN (previously Republic Protocol)** – a protocol for providing access to inter-blockchain liquidity&#x20;

**Kyber Network** – an on-chain liquidity protocol&#x20;

**0x** – an open protocol that enables the peer-to-peer exchange of assets&#x20;

**Bancor** – another on-chain liquidity protocol

It’s important to note that several of the projects that arose during the 2017 ICO hysteria are currently regarded as the top protocols in Defi, despite the negative reputation of that period. The concept of people interacting with smart contracts that contained pooled funds from several users rather than directly with other users was one of the major breakthroughs at the time.&#x20;

As a result, a ”user-to-contract” model was devised, which was better suited for decentralized applications since it necessitated fewer transactions with the underlying blockchain than the user-to-user model. Defi went through a reasonably peaceful phase following the end of the ICO euphoria and the onset of the bear market, at least from the outside. In actuality, important Defi protocols were being developed behind the scenes.&#x20;

This time frame is often referred to as ”Before COMP.” Later on, we’ll see why Compound’s COMP token liquidity mining represented a significant advance for Defi. Let’s first look at some other crucial procedures and activities that took place during that ostensibly peaceful time period before we move on to this.
