# Installation

There are a few ways of installing Solidity Compiler:

1. _**Remix**_\
   No installation needed, Ideal for small contracts and learning Solidty\
   [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/)\

2.  _**npm / Node.js**_\
    npm helps to install 'solcjs', a solidity compiler, which has relatively fewer features than compilers further down the page

    <pre><code><strong>npm install -g solc</strong></code></pre>


3. _**Docker**_\
   Docker images of Solidity builds are available using the `solc` image from the `ethereum` organisation.\

4. _**Linux Packages**_\
   [https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases)\

5. _**macOS Packages**_\
   We distribute the Solidity compiler through Homebrew as a build-from-source version. Pre-built bottles are currently not supported.\

6. _**Static Binaries**_\
   repository is maintained containing static builds of past and current compiler versions for all supported platforms at [solc-bin](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/). This is also the location where you can find the nightly builds.\
