# Intro

Solidity is a programming language specifically catered to the development of Smart Contracts. The nature of the language is similar to JavaScript, also influenced by C++ and Python. Solidity is designed to target the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).&#x20;

Although other languages are also able to code smart contracts, Solidity is the preferred language currently. Solidity supports a wide variety of features, such as inheritance, libraries and user defined types.

Solidity compiler is able to decompose high level coding to more simplified commands.&#x20;
