### What is consensus algorithm?

It is often said that the consensus algorithm is the core of blockchain, the reason is that the whole blockchain depends on it to ensure the consistency of distributed nodes and the trustworthiness of data on the blockchain.

Perhaps in a cloud-based information system, due to the existence of centralized nodes, we only need to upload and synchronize data and download updates for the central node. In a blockchain system, each node needs to ensure that its ledger is synchronized with the ledger information of other nodes, so specifying a process rule for each node to reach this consensus result becomes the top priority of the blockchain algorithm, and the consensus algorithm refers to such an algorithm that enables distributed nodes to negotiate a consensus decision together beforehand. We will then briefly introduce the various consensus algorithms and their features.
