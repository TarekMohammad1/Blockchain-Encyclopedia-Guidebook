# FLP Impossibility Principle

FLP (Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson) impossibility principle is considered one of the most important principles in distributed systems. Fischer, Lynch and Patterson concluded in [\[1\]](flp-impossibility-principle.md#reference) that in asynchronous model systems with reliable networks but with the possibility of node failure, there is no deterministic consensus algorithm to solve the consistency problem.
