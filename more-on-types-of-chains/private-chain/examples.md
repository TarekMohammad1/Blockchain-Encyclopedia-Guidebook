# Examples


**Enterprise Ethereum (private):** Actually, Enterprise Ethereum is actually one of the recent additions. Ethereum is actually a public blockchain that got traction based on the features it introduced. But it was difficult for enterprise companies to even use up those features as it’s fully a public network.

So EEA(Enterprise Ethereum Alliance) started to roll out an Ethereum private blockchain version just for the sake of commercial use. Thereby, this Ethereum private blockchain offers a new type of private network that uses public network benefits as well. More so, the Ethereum private blockchain also updates based on the public network as well. So, it can continue to grow into a vaster network.

**Hyperledger Fabric:** This is one of the popular private blockchain platforms on the list so far. In reality, Hyperledger Fabric is full of features that anyone can use in any kind of industry. Also, it comes with permissioned access, so any member has to authorize their identities before they can get in it.

More so, it comes with a modular structure, which means you can plug and play any type of item in this. Furthermore, it allows you to customize to a great length. The transaction speed is fast and, in reality, excels at any other platform in the marketplace.

**Corda:** Corda has two types of versions one is open-source, and another one is for commercial usage. But Corda blockchain is more suited for financial industries such as banking sectors, insurances, real estate, and so on. Also, Corda happens to offer the best possible firewall against any online attacks. So, it’s a great option to use as a security system. Though it is still evolving, there are some talks regarding Corda being adapted into Hyperledger.\\

**Ripple:** Ripple is another private blockchain platform, that is solely for the financial sector. In reality, it comes with a native token of its own, and by using this you can complete transactions within seconds. Anyhow, previously many people thought that Ripple is only suited for finance industries.\\

But slowly even governments are starting to use this platform for their own benefits. The transaction costs for this platform are relatively low, and it offers a secured consensus protocol.\\

**Quorum:** JP. Morgan is the one behind the success of Quorum. In reality, Quorum is actually a private version of Ethereum. But the developers tweaked the Ethereum platform to make certain moderations and make it enterprise-friendly.\\

Enterprise Ethereum and Quorum are not the same things. So, make sure not to confuse them. They both use different methods and different protocols to reach consensus. Also, their privacy policies are different.\\
