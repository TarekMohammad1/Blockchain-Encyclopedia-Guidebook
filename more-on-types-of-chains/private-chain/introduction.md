# Introduction

Private blockchains, as the name suggests, are privately implemented and controlled by a single organization or institution. The chain owner has the ultimate read and write access to the chain, whilst other authorized nodes are limited and controlled. It is still can be considered a form of decentralized peer-to-peer network. However, the network is governed by one entity that determines who is allowed to join, execute a consensus protocol, and maintain the shared ledger. This can substantially increase trust and confidence between participants based on the purpose of use. A private blockchain may be operated behind a corporate firewall and even hosted on-premises, thanks to these blockchain platforms. Fabric, Sawtooth, Corda, and Quorum are all examples of private blockchain platforms.

Its major features include full privacy, high efficiency, stability, & low fee: The main distinction between public and private blockchains is who is allowed to join the network, carry out the consensus protocol that determines mining rights and rewards, and maintain the shared ledger. The owner or operator has authority over what entries on the blockchain are necessary A private blockchain isn’t truly decentralized since it’s a distributed ledger that functions as a closed, secure database based on cryptography ideas. Not everyone can operate a full node on the private blockchain, conduct transactions, or authenticate/validate blockchain modifications.

There are notable providers of private blockchains, such as [Ripple](https://www.ripple.com/), [R3’s Corda](https://www.r3.com/platform/) and [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric).&#x20;

Here is a quick comparison of a public versus private blockchain:

|             Access            | In this type of blockchain anyone can read, write and  participate in a blockchain. Hence, it is permissionless blockchain.                                                                                                   | In this type of blockchain read and write is done upon invitation,  hence it is a permissioned blockchain.                                                                  |

| Decentralized vs  Centralized |                                                                                                         Decentralized                                                                                                         |                                                                               More centralized                                                                              |
|      Order of  Magnitude      | The order of magnitude of a public blockchain is lesser than that of a  private blockchain as it is lighter and provides transactional throughput.                                                                            | The order of magnitude is more as compared  to the public blockchain.                                                                                                       |
|          Native Token         |                                                                                                              Yes                                                                                                              |                                                                                Not necessary                                                                                |
|             Speed             |                                                                                                              Slow                                                                                                             |                                                                                     Fast                                                                                    |
|        Transactions/sec       |                                                                                                             Lesser                                                                                                            |                                                                                     More                                                                                    |
|            Security           | More secure due to decentralization and active participation.  Due to the higher number of nodes in the network,  it is nearly impossible for ‘bad actors’ to attack the system  and gain control over the consensus network. | A private blockchain is more prone to hacks, risks,  and data breaches/ manipulation.  It is easy for bad actors to endanger the entire network.  Hence, it is less secure. |
|      Energy  Consumption      | A public blockchain consumes more energy than a private blockchain  as it requires a significant amount of electrical resources to function  and achieve network consensus.                                                   | Private blockchains consume a lot less energy and power.                                                                                                                    |
|     Consensus  algorithms     | Some are proof of work, proof of stake, proof of burn, proof of space etc.                                                                                                                                                    | Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), Raft, and Istanbul BFT  can be used only in case of private blockchains.                                                                      |
|            Attacks            | In a public blockchain, no one knows who each validator is and  this increases the risk of potential collision or a 51% attack.                                                                                               | In a private blockchain, there is no chance of minor collision.  Each validator is known and they have the suitable credentials  to be a part of the network.               |
|            Effects            | Potential to disrupt current business models through disintermediation.  There is lower infrastructure cost.  No need to maintain servers or system admins radically.  Hence reducing the cost of creating and running dApps. | Reduces transaction cost and data redundancies  and replace legacy systems,  simplifying documents handling and  getting rid of semi manual compliance mechanisms.          |
