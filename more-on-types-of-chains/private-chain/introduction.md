# Introduction

Private blockchains, as the name suggests, are privately implemented and controlled by a single organization or institution. The chain owner has the ultimate read and write access to the chain, whilst other authorized nodes are limited and controlled. It is still can be considered a form of decentralized peer-to-peer network. However, the network is governed by one entity that determines who is allowed to join, execute a consensus protocol, and maintain the shared ledger. This can substantially increase trust and confidence between participants based on the purpose of use. A private blockchain may be operated behind a corporate firewall and even hosted on-premises, thanks to these blockchain platforms. Fabric, Sawtooth, Corda, and Quorum are all examples of private blockchain platforms.

Its major features include full privacy, high efficiency, stability, & low fee: The main distinction between public and private blockchains is who is allowed to join the network, carry out the consensus protocol that determines mining rights and rewards, and maintain the shared ledger. The owner or operator has authority over what entries on the blockchain are necessary A private blockchain isn’t truly decentralized since it’s a distributed ledger that functions as a closed, secure database based on cryptography ideas. Not everyone can operate a full node on the private blockchain, conduct transactions, or authenticate/validate blockchain modifications.

There are notable providers of private blockchains, such as [Ripple](https://www.ripple.com/), [R3’s Corda](https://www.r3.com/platform/) and [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric).&#x20;
