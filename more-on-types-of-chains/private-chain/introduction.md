# Introduction

Private blockchains, as the name suggests, are privately implemented and controlled by a single organization or institution. The chain owner has the ultimate read and write access to the chain, whilst other authorized nodes are limited and controlled. Such blockchains are not targeted towards public usage, but more catered to companies' internal networking, especially for companies that require high levels of privacy.&#x20;

&#x20;There are notable providers of private blockchains, such as [Ripple](https://www.ripple.com/), [R3â€™s Corda](https://www.r3.com/platform/) and [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric).&#x20;
