# Intro

As the first type of blockchain technology, there is no limitation in access and participation in any on-chain activities within the public chain, e.g., reading data, sending confirmable transactions, and competing for billing. The decentralized nature of the public chain requires a method for verifying the authentication of data. A consensus algorithm is often used among participants in the blockchain so that they reach an agreement on the current state of the ledger. Proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS) are two common consensus methods. Some most famous public blockchain networks are BTC, ETH, and LTC.
