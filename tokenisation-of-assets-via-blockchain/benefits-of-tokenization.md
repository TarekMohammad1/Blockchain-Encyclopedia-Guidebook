# Benefits of Tokenization

Examples of tokenization using DLT may deliver efficiency gains through the transfer of value without the need for trusted centralized intermediaries and/or through the efficient automation of processes, resulting in faster, potentially cheaper, and frictionless transactions driven by disintermediation and automation. Smart contracts not only reduce costs and streamline processes but also may facilitate corporate actions (e.g. coupon or dividend payments, voting), escrow arrangements (e.g. release of funds), and collateral management (e.g. exchange of ownership interest).&#x20;

Increased transparency may also be achieved in terms of regulatory compliance and interaction with regulators: as programmed regulatory restrictions are automatically enforced, the regulator may be automatically notified through smart contracts when restrictions are modified or turned off. (Note that DLTs do not resolve ‘garbage in, garbage out’).&#x20;

The benefits from the wider use of assets tokenization may be enjoyed by investors who would have the possibility to hold fractional ownership of assets (or interest in funds). Fractional ownership may allow for more inclusive access of small and retail investors to somehow restricted asset classes while enabling global pools of capital to reach parts of the financial markets previously reserved for large investors. Private placements of equity or debt of small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) are such examples.&#x20;

It is also notable that a large part of the market argues that tokenization of securities may benefit from a relatively clear regulatory and supervisory framework when compared to other crypto-assets, allowing for better regulatory compliance by its users. Also, increased efficiencies in clearing and settlement processes may perhaps be the biggest breakthrough of asset tokenization and may reduce counterparty and operational risks in permissioned blockchains. Uncertainty around settlement finality in public permissionless blockchains eliminates such benefits.
