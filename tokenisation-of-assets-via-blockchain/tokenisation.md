# Tokenisation

Tokenisation is the process of digitally representing an existing real asset on a distributed ledger. Tokens issued in asset tokenization exist on the chain and carry the rights of the asset they represent, acting as a store of value. The real asset continues to exist in the off-chain world, and for physical assets, these should be placed in custody to ensure that the tokens are safely and constantly backed by these assets.&#x20;

Note that in this respect, tokens issued in ICOs are generated within the blockchain and are not backed by an off-chain security or another asset. This has import implications for market structure and governance, given that tokens issued in ICOs are independent of the conventional, of-chain part of the market.&#x20;

Examples of tokenization of assets native to the blockchain include tokenization of the equity of a nonlisted company. Investment funds and alternatives such as private equity and venture capital funds, as well as real estate investment vehicles, are also thought to be suitable for tokenization given the near-total absence of liquidity of participation in such funds/vehicles.&#x20;

From a token-holder perspective, if a blockchain were to face operational failure for whatever reason, shareholders whose shares exist off the chain and which were “recorded” on the blockchain would remain shareholders post-failure, as opposed to native token-holders, where there is no real-world connection at all.&#x20;

When it comes to financial assets, tokenization of securities (equity and/or debt) is seen by the market as the sector with the most imminent potential for growth. This is mainly driven by the recent hype around tokens issued in, mostly unregulated, ICOs and the currently trending “Security Token Offerings” or STOs, which have been marketed as a more “regulatory-compliant” successor of ICOs aiming to raise capital.&#x20;

Tokens can either be directly issued on the blockchain or issued as conventional securities that are tokenized at a second stage. (For one note, the State of Delaware in the U.S. has updated its General Corporation Law to allow any company to issue equity in the form of a token and for tokenized stock or share to be legally admissible as evidence of ownership (Delaware State Senate, 2017))
