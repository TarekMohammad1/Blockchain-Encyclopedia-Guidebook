This part of the document summarizes major takeaways from “The Tokenisation of Assets and Potential Implications for Financial Markets” (OECD, 2020, Blockchain Policy Series). The report provides a high-level overview of asset tokenisation; touches upon its main benefits; examines challenges to its wider adoption; discusses its potential disruptive effect on trading, liquidity, pricing, clearing and settlement; and analyzes the increased importance of custodianship in a tokenised environment. The report concludes by discussing some of the high level policy implications of asset tokenisation in the financial markets.
