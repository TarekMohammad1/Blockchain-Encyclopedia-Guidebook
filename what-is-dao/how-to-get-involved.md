# How to get involved?

When you’ve discovered a project that piques your interest, there are a few different ways to become involved right away. Understanding each DAO’s primary objective is the first step because, in my opinion, not all DAOs operate with the same aim.&#x20;

Understanding the kind of voting privileges offered to token holders and the kinds of proposals at risk is crucial for DAOs focusing on technical governance.&#x20;

Some platforms, like Uniswap, allow token holders to vote on how much of the fees that the protocol earns should be divided among themselves. Token owners in other protocols, like Compound, can decide how these protocol fees will be allocated to system updates and issue repairs.&#x20;

With this strategy, anyone who is ad hoc interested in the project or a freelancer can join and be paid for their labor through DAO grant-funded projects (DAOs regularly post these sorts of ad hoc projects on their Discord server).&#x20;

For other DAOs, the emphasis is more on treasury pooling and allocation than on control over the technical components of the protocol.&#x20;

The transparency of a DAO is one of the main lessons to be learned from this. Each proposal’s specifics are easily accessible, voting history is continuously logged, and even individual token holders’ voting histories may be seen.
