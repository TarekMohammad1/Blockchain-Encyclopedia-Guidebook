# Top 5 DAOs:

**Decentralized DAO:**

Decentraland Instead of a central authority, a decentralized entity oversees the virtual land parcels of DAO. It combines the duties of a decentralized city planning committee and a homeowners association. Everyone has the right to vote regardless of how much virtual property they own, unlike elected officials. This explains why the voting totals for some proposals appear low.&#x20;

That virtual area would cover almost 9 square kilometers of actual land. A Decentraverse property was purchased by the Metaverse Group, a Tokens.com business aspiring to become an industry developer, for $2.43 million last year.

**MakerDAO:**

The platform is now essential for interacting with everything decentralized thanks to the adoption of Maker DAO’s algorithmic stablecoin. This DAO project is focused on investigating the novel and intriguing area of integrating non-crypto assets into the current crypto trends. Holders of MKR chose to adopt tokenized representations of freight and shipping invoices, agricultural real estate, and short**-**term trade receivables during the platform’s governance token vote last year.&#x20;

**Mirror DAO:**&#x20;

Mirror resembles Medium, Kickstarter, and Substack in many ways. When The Mirror debuted in February 2021, getting access required placing in the top 10 of its weekly WRITE competition, in which current members choose prospective members. One WRITE voucher, redeemable for a blog run by the Mirror, was given to each winner. Later, Mirror reversed policy and permitted anybody to use the DAO platform, however, names must still be purchased through the WRITE race.

**Friends with Benefits DAO:**

”FriendsWithBenefits,” or FWB for short, appears to be a membership-only organization yet poses important issues about the building of social network value. How does Web3 technology directly improve Facebook and Spotify? You must first purchase some FWB DAO cryptocurrency tokens. You can do more things the more of these you have. To sign up for the community’s newsletter, spend FWB tokens, which now cost about $15 each.&#x20;

Five DAO tokens will get you access to a variety of community-driven events as well as the FWB’s Cities initiative, a decentralized computer system that establishes FWB hubs in New York, London, and Los Angeles.

**Compound:**

Users possessing COMP tokens are promoted to decision-making roles within the government ecosystem in Compound. The governance token for the protocol is the token COMP. A protocol called compound enables programmers to open financial applications using interest rates determined by an algorithm.&#x20;

With a compound loan, you can borrow money with other assets as security, such as cash. For instance, it is possible to keep bitcoins as collateral and exchange them for dollars. The compound application can be viewed by anyone on the globe because it is built on Ethereum and cannot be restricted. Code that has been extensively audited performs all calculations.
